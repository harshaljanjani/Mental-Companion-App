## <ins>About</ins> <ins>The</ins> <ins>Project</ins>

The application intends to provide an aid in solving the **mass network of mental health issues faced by people living in India**, the target group of the project being **youngsters** and **adolescents** (high-school students and university students). The app notifies you to take a single **'<ins>candid</ins>'** snapshot of yourself once a day, at random times each day. The data collected overtime is stored in a database, and used for analytics:
1) To provide a clear and concise view of how your mental health has been over a period of time (say a month or two, or a year), the period being completely subjective. Data is presented to the user in easily understandable graphs and mental health cards, on a straightforward user interface.
2) The analytics module graphs/visualizes **temporal data** as soon as the user clicks his/her snapshot, depending on the emotion displayed by  the user at the time of day. It also generates **5 daily-tasks** for the user to complete, depending upon the users past mental health history, inclined towards **cognitive betterment** in the long run. 
3) **It is important to note that the application is not a social-media platform, and solely focuses on personal development and cognitive betterment of the user, and thus requires active participation from the user as well. Hence, benefits reaped completely depend on how true he/she is being to the MoodCheck algorithm, and whether the given data was in-fact, the users real emotion felt in that moment.**
4) The algorithm does not ensure immediate results, and would in-fact require atleast a month of data and regular task-completion from the user in order to visualize benefits in the long run.
5) __On extended use of the application, the user could additionally consult their nearest psychiatrist or therapist, and provide them with the analytics information collected by the app, thus being of service to their diagnosis of the userâ€™s mental health issue, and thus ensuring faster benefits.__
